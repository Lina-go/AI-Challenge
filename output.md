# SUPPLY CHAIN

Supply chains in the defence industry are characterised by complex relationships and limited supply markets constrained by proprietary products or technology and specialised certifications. The high proportion of specific materials and processes combined with a broad product range leads to a significant proportion of single and sole-sourcing as only few companies have the capability to manufacture the products or command the processes. Military authorities as end users of our products qualify defence products based on performance, the manufacturing process, manufacturing location and suppliers. Specific legislation, such as the War Weapons Control Act, the Foreign Trade and Payments Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), to cite just a few, must be taken into consideration when procuring defence technology. The supply chain ranges from Tier 1 (direct components) through Tier 2 and Tier N (Removed from raw materials suppliers).

The Rheinmetall Group Purchasing department is responsible for cooperation with suppliers. The aim of Group Purchasing is to establish and maintain long-term supplier relationships. The purchasing organization is controlled by the Group Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO). It is managed via a matrix structure, with entity based procurement departments reporting to the CPO, supported by centralized procurement teams, responsible for Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) or Commodity Management. Further support is provided by Rheinmetall Group Purchasing Council (RGP Council). Rheinmetall does not tolerate human rights violations and strives to counteract any potentially negative impacts on value chain workers within its own sphere of influence. Guidelines such as the Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) and specifications such as the instruction on supplier screening in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG) state that Rheinmetall expects suppliers to have the same understanding with regard to respecting human rights, for example by agreeing on disclosure clauses. The aforementioned guideline or requirement refers to workers in the upstream value chain (Tier 1) with whom contractual relationships exist. Human rights violations can affect workers in the far upstream value chain who are involved in the extraction or processing of raw materials in the relevant regions. Rheinmetall's responsible Minerals Sourcing Policy from Y2022 ensures that no raw materials are sourced from conflict regions.

In addition to the SCoC, which must be signed by the Tier 1 supplier at the beginning of each business relationship, Group Purchasing department has implemented a comprehensive supplier risk process. The ESG Supply Chain team at Group headquarters carries out regular risk analyses together with the divisions. The corresponding regular reporting takes place on a quarterly basis and is presented to the Chief Purchasing Officer and the divisional purchasing managers as part of the operational Rheinmetall Group Purchasing Council. The RGP Council also decides on topics such as possible adjustments to supplier risk analysis. The risk analysis is supported by the software provider EcoVadis and is carried out on an ongoing basis. In addition, the Risk Management Council (a cross-divisional council of the Rheinmetall Group) is working on new criteria and processes to improve due diligence checks.

The SCoC and the instructions for supplier audits in accordance with the German Supply Chain Duties Act are updated regularly by Group Purchasing. Both documents have an effect on Tier 1 to Tier N suppliers and their employees. At the same time, they are a central working tool for those at Rheinmetall who make purchasing decisions. Signing the SCoC is mandatory for direct suppliers as part of the onboarding process. Only in exceptional cases and in consultation with the legal department or compliance can minor adjustments to the SCoC or equivalent agreements be accepted as an alternative. New supplier systems are checked and approved at divisional level.

The RGP Council is responsible for its implementation. The SCoC refers to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ILO Core Conventions, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact and the Diversity Charter, which stand for the prevention of human rights violations such as human trafficking and child and forced labour.

We have and continue to expand and qualify a broad network in Australia to support delivery of Australian Industrial Capability commitments and introduction of Australian suppliers to the Rheinmetall Global Supply Chain. Rheinmetall Group products are dependent on a highly qualified and well-qualified supply base. The Group seeks a high degree of localisation and works with suppliers with recognised standards, such as ISO 9001, from its suppliers. Environment, Social Responsibility and Governance criteria form part of the evaluation and selection process when considering new supplier relationships as well as ongoing surveillance.

A growing number of national and supranational laws such as Australian and German laws and regulations govern the assumption of responsibility in global supply chains. The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which particularly obligates companies to monitor their suppliers' compliance with internationally recognized human rights and environmental concerns, and to ensure lawful dealings with business partners throughout the entire supplier relationship.

The risk management system for suppliers is managed by the ESG Supply Chain unit, which was established in 2023 as part of the cross-divisional purchasing organization. This ensures that Rheinmetall implements and fulfills the due diligence obligations uniformly throughout the Group.

The methodical, objective and reliable assessment in terms of sustainability across the very complex international supplier basis requires a Group-wide, standardized, system-supported process for recording and analysing supplier information to assess the sustainability performance of our most important suppliers. To do this, we use the methodology stored in the web-based platform of the internationally renowned service provider EcoVadis.

The ESG rating is based on a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) tailored to the respective supplier regarding three risk aspects (company size, industry sector, purchasing parameters), the review of submitted individual documents, and the evaluation of information from external sources. EcoVadis checks the individual aspects including a total of 21 indicators in the areas of environment, labour and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement.

The aim of all measures is to initiate actual changes for the better in our suppliers’ environmental, social, labour and governance standards.

As part of the evidence-based ESG assessment, around 1.5% of the suppliers were classified as high or very high risk in the first stage of assessment. In the second phase, these identified suppliers were either requested to submit their EcoVadis scorecard or to submit an SAQ. The evaluation of the scorecards shows that, according to the EcoVadis methodology, around 60% of these suppliers have a sustainability performance rated “Good” (score 45-64) by EcoVadis. Only 1% of suppliers were classified as “critical” and were analyzed individually. In line with the risk-based approach, those critical suppliers who rejected an EcoVadis assessment or whose assessments had expired are urged to renew the assessment or participate in the rating. If necessary, an individual ESG supplier audit is carried out.

The central Compliance Due Diligence team also conducts business partner reviews for new and existing suppliers using defined criteria and value thresholds, which include ESG aspects such as human rights and environmental factors. In the event of anomalies, the central area Corporate Social Responsibility is informed and involved in the investigation process.

**“We are committed to ensuring that there are no Modern Slavery activities in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Modern Slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.”**

## HUMAN RIGHTS AND MODERN SLAVERY

Rheinmetall’s values and principles are actively promoted within the supply chain and therefore expect all business partners to share Rheinmetall’s principles regarding responsible and fair conduct to employees, customers, suppliers and the public. Rheinmetall expect suppliers to take into account the principles laid down in the SCoC – which is available in several languages and is valid worldwide. In January 2025, a revised Supplier Code of Conduct was published as a binding component of contracts with suppliers. On this basis, Rheinmetall can now act more proactively in partnership with its supplier partners to improve performance, sustainability and compliance aspects in the procurement process and to achieve corporate development goals at the economic, social, ecological and regulatory levels.

## TRAINING

During 2024, Rheinmetall Defence Australia continued to raise awareness through general training on Human Rights and Modern Slavery across our workforce. All new staff in Australia must complete the Code of Conduct eLearning module and the General Compliance Awareness training program. These programs facilitate knowledge about Human Rights and anti-discrimination including elements referring to the “Modern Slavery Act 2018”.

To ensure a full understanding of the risks of Modern Slavery in our supply chains, we provide dedicated training to all procurement staff, who are responsible for sourcing and supplier management. In 2021, we reinforced ethical values across all procurement and supply practices by rolling out Ethical Procurement and Supply training with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS). With successful completion of this program, our procurement employees demonstrate their on-going commitment to ethical procurement and sustainable supply chains. We are convinced that training our procurement workforce has significantly increased their awareness of Modern Slavery risks. In addition to the training, we have signed a Statement of Commitment to Corporate Ethical Procurement and Supply with CIPS.

# WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM

Rheinmetall Group provides a whistleblowing tool for employees and suppliers to raise any concerns with regard to matters covered by the Group’s Code of Conduct. A Confidential Whistleblower Hotline Service, whistleblowing policies and other implemented safeguards are protecting the identity and integrity of any whistleblower.  
Any potential breach of this policy/related policies will be managed in accordance with our standard processes. Any person involved in investigations into possible breaches of compliance are managed with procedural fairness. Where we identify failures by our employees to adhere to our code of conduct and policy, we take appropriate steps to address those failings. This may involve disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.  
Any information that is received is systematically analysed. An incident management guideline on how to deal with suspected cases aims to ensure that the handling of information is also independent, transparent and fair as well as being subject to high standards.

# HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT

Rheinmetall Defence Australia is committed to providing a physical and psychologically safe workplace for all employees, contractors, visitors and the wider community. We will achieve this by minimising our impact on the environments in which we work, and taking an integrated approach to managing health, wellbeing, safety and environmental (“HSE”) risks. By doing this we believe our management of health and safety contributes to the health and safety of those we interact with, including our customers and partners.  
We recognise that workers’ performance may be negatively affected where they are aggrieved or feel that they have not been treated fairly in the workplace. Rheinmetall Defence Australia is therefore committed to providing a workplace which is free from victimisation and values fairness, safety, and equality by providing all employees with access to a grievance and appeal procedure where they have a legitimate personal grievance related to the workplace. Rheinmetall Defence Australia encourage employees to raise grievances where they arise in line with policies and procedures. We will aim to deal with any complaints received in a prompt, sensitive, impartial, confidential and supportive way to seek a resolution and to prevent future conflict.

# INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY REVIEWS

Rheinmetall Group supports transparent reporting based on globally recognized standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative and – where possible – through continuous improvement of control and Environment, Social and Governance ratings from internationally renowned agencies such as MSCI, ISS ESG, Sustainalytics and Gaia.  

The Human Rights and Supply Chain subcategory metric of the Global Reporting Initiative measures a company’s commitment to respecting fundamental human rights conventions, and its ability to maintain its license to operate by supporting freedom of association and excluding child, forced or compulsory labour. This subcategory covers a company’s transparency in overseas sourcing disclosure and monitoring and a company’s relationship with and respect for the human rights of Indigenous peoples near its proposed or current operations.  

Rheinmetall Group achieved high scores and an above industry average in its CSR / ESG Results:

## Table 1

| MSCI ESG | ISS ESG | S&P Global | Refinitiv ESG Company Score | ESG Book | Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating |
|----------|---------|------------|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| AA (Scale: CCC-AAA); only 1 out of 34 companies score higher | C (Scale: D- - A+); only 2 out of 72 companies score higher | 34 (Scale 0–100); industry average 29 | 81; 1st place out of 119 rated companies | 56.45 | 26.8 | Industry rank 15/104 |

# FUTURE COMMITMENTS

The mining of raw materials such as bauxite, nitrocellulose (linters), tin, tungsten, copper, cobalt, gold, aluminum and the processing of raw materials such as plastics and semiconductors (mica) in various regions around the world such as Guinea, Brazil, the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Vietnam poses a potential risk of human rights violations. Cases of child and forced labor, lack of health and safety protection, violence and harassment have become known through media reports and pose potential negative impacts through the use or extraction of materials.  
The generic analysis of the deeper value chain (Tier N suppliers) and their processes confirmed these potential risks, although no specific group of affected parties was identified. Rheinmetall plans to gain more comprehensive insights into the upstream value chain at the Tier N supplier level from 2025 onwards.
