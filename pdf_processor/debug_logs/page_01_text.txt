 # Modern Slavery Statement 2021

**Rheinmetall Australia Pty Ltd**

This statement is made pursuant to the **Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth)** and outlines Rheinmetall Australia Pty Ltd's approach to identifying and addressing modern slavery risks in our operations and supply chains.

## 1. Reporting Entities

Rheinmetall Australia Pty Ltd is a subsidiary of **Rheinmetall AG**, a global technology group operating in the fields of defence, mobility, and security. This statement covers all entities within the Rheinmetall Group that are subject to the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) and are based in Australia.

## 2. Our Approach

Rheinmetall is committed to preventing modern slavery in our operations and supply chains. We have established a **Modern Slavery Risk Assessment** process to identify potential risks of modern slavery within our business and supply chain. This process includes:

- **Supplier Due Diligence**: We conduct due diligence on all new suppliers, assessing their compliance with anti-slavery and human trafficking laws and regulations.
- **Training and Awareness**: We provide training to our employees and supply chain partners on modern slavery risks and how to identify and report them.
- **Supply Chain Mapping**: We maintain a comprehensive map of our supply chain, including tier 1 suppliers, to better understand and manage modern slavery risks.

## 3. Risk Assessment

Our risk assessment process includes:

- **Risk Categorisation**: We categorise suppliers based on their risk level, with higher risk suppliers subject to more frequent and detailed assessments.
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: We implement strategies to mitigate modern slavery risks, including supplier code of conducts, audits, and corrective action plans.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: We continuously monitor our supply chain for changes that may increase the risk of modern slavery, and take appropriate action where necessary.

## 4. Performance Indicators

We measure our performance in addressing modern slavery risks through:

- **Supplier Compliance**: We track supplier compliance with anti-slavery and human trafficking laws and regulations.
- **Training Completion Rates**: We monitor the completion rates of our training programs on modern slavery awareness and prevention.
- **Supply Chain Mapping Accuracy**: We assess the accuracy of our supply chain mapping process to ensure it remains up-to-date and comprehensive.

## 5. Reporting

We report on our actions to address modern slavery risks annually, in accordance with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth). Our report will include:

- **Modern Slavery Statement**: A statement outlining our approach to addressing modern slavery risks.
- **Risk Assessment Report**: A detailed report on our risk assessment process, including the results of our supplier due diligence and training completion rates.
- **Performance Indicator Report**: A report detailing our performance in addressing modern slavery risks, including supplier compliance rates and the accuracy of our supply chain mapping process.

## 6. Stakeholder Engagement
