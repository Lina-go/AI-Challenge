You are extracting figure content from a modern slavery statement document page. Focus ONLY on visual elements like charts, diagrams, and graphical content.

Your task:
1. Identify all figures, charts, diagrams, and visual representations
2. Extract and describe the semantic content of each visual element
3. Ignore any narrative text or tabular data
4. Determine if each figure contains meaningful information worth parsing

For modern slavery documents, look for these figure types:
- Organizational charts (company structure, subsidiary relationships)
- Process flow diagrams (due diligence workflows, reporting processes)
- Supply chain maps (geographic representations, supplier networks)
- Risk heat maps or matrices (visual risk assessments)
- Timeline diagrams (implementation schedules, compliance milestones)
- Infographics (statistical summaries, key metrics visualizations)

Figure extraction rules:
- For organizational charts: Describe the hierarchy and relationships
- For process flows: List the sequential steps or decision points
- For maps: Identify locations and connections shown
- For charts/graphs: Extract the underlying data and relationships
- For infographics: Capture key statistics and visual messages

Output format:
- Extract each figure as structured markdown content
- Number figures consecutively starting from 1 within the page
- Use the format: FIGURE_{sequential_number} followed by the content
- For non-informative figures, use: FIGURE_{sequential_number} followed by NOT_INFORMATIVE
- Provide a descriptive title for informative figures
- Extract or describe the content in structured format (lists, data points, relationships)
- Separate multiple figures with blank lines

Example output:
FIGURE_1
**Organizational Structure - Heidelberg Materials Australia**
- Parent Company: Heidelberg Materials AG (Germany)
  - Subsidiary: Heidelberg Materials Australia Group Holdings Pty Ltd
    - Operating Company: Heidelberg Materials Australia Holdings Pty Ltd
    - Brands: Heidelberg Materials, Hymix, Alex Fraser, Suncoast Asphalt

FIGURE_2
**Risk Assessment Process Flow**
1. Supplier Identification
2. Initial Risk Screening
3. Enhanced Due Diligence (High Risk)
4. Contract Requirements
5. Ongoing Monitoring
6. Annual Review

Example output for non-informative figures:
FIGURE_3
NOT_INFORMATIVE

Important:
- Do NOT extract narrative text or tables
- Focus only on visual/graphical content
- Preserve hierarchical relationships shown in diagrams
- Extract quantitative data from charts when visible
- Describe visual elements that cannot be directly transcribed
- If a figure contains no meaningful information (decorative elements, logos only, empty charts), mark it as NOT_INFORMATIVE

Output each figure in this format with proper identification headers and either structured content description or NOT_INFORMATIVE.
