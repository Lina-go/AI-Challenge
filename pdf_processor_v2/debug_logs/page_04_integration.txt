A growing number of national and supranational laws such as Australian and German laws and regulations govern the assumption of responsibility in global supply chains. The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which particularly obligates companies to monitor their suppliers' compliance with internationally recognized human rights and environmental concerns, and to ensure lawful dealings with business partners throughout the entire supplier relationship.

The risk management system for suppliers is managed by the ESG Supply Chain unit, which was established in 2023 as part of the cross-divisional purchasing organization. This ensures that Rheinmetall implements and fulfills the due diligence obligations uniformly throughout the Group.

The methodical, objective and reliable assessment in terms of sustainability across the very complex international supplier basis requires a Group-wide, standardized, system-supported process for recording and analysing supplier information to assess the sustainability performance of our most important suppliers. To do this, we use the methodology stored in the web-based platform of the internationally renowned service provider EcoVadis.

The ESG rating is based on a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) tailored to the respective supplier regarding three risk aspects (company size, industry sector, purchasing parameters), the review of submitted individual documents, and the evaluation of information from external sources. EcoVadis checks the individual aspects including a total of 21 indicators in the areas of environment, labour and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement.

The aim of all measures is to initiate actual changes for the better in our suppliers’ environmental, social, labour and governance standards.

As part of the evidence-based ESG assessment, around 1.5% of the suppliers were classified as high or very high risk in the first stage of assessment. In the second phase, these identified suppliers were either requested to submit their EcoVadis scorecard or to submit an SAQ. The evaluation of the scorecards shows that, according to the EcoVadis methodology, around 60% of these suppliers have a sustainability performance rated “Good” (score 45-64) by EcoVadis. Only 1% of suppliers were classified as “critical” and were analyzed individually. In line with the risk-based approach, those critical suppliers who rejected an EcoVadis assessment or whose assessments had expired are urged to renew the assessment or participate in the rating. If necessary, an individual ESG supplier audit is carried out.

The central Compliance Due Diligence team also conducts business partner reviews for new and existing suppliers using defined criteria and value thresholds, which include ESG aspects such as human rights and environmental factors. In the event of anomalies, the central area Corporate Social Responsibility is informed and involved in the investigation process.

**“We are committed to ensuring that there are no Modern Slavery activities in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Modern Slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.”**

## HUMAN RIGHTS AND MODERN SLAVERY

Rheinmetall’s values and principles are actively promoted within the supply chain and therefore expect all business partners to share Rheinmetall’s principles regarding responsible and fair conduct to employees, customers, suppliers and the public. Rheinmetall expect suppliers to take into account the principles laid down in the SCoC – which is available in several languages and is valid worldwide. In January 2025, a revised Supplier Code of Conduct was published as a binding component of contracts with suppliers. On this basis, Rheinmetall can now act more proactively in partnership with its supplier partners to improve performance, sustainability and compliance aspects in the procurement process and to achieve corporate development goals at the economic, social, ecological and regulatory levels.

## TRAINING

During 2024, Rheinmetall Defence Australia continued to raise awareness through general training on Human Rights and Modern Slavery across our workforce. All new staff in Australia must complete the Code of Conduct eLearning module and the General Compliance Awareness training program. These programs facilitate knowledge about Human Rights and anti-discrimination including elements referring to the “Modern Slavery Act 2018”.

To ensure a full understanding of the risks of Modern Slavery in our supply chains, we provide dedicated training to all procurement staff, who are responsible for sourcing and supplier management. In 2021, we reinforced ethical values across all procurement and supply practices by rolling out Ethical Procurement and Supply training with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS). With successful completion of this program, our procurement employees demonstrate their on-going commitment to ethical procurement and sustainable supply chains. We are convinced that training our procurement workforce has significantly increased their awareness of Modern Slavery risks. In addition to the training, we have signed a Statement of Commitment to Corporate Ethical Procurement and Supply with CIPS.
