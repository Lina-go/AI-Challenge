You are analyzing a page from a modern slavery statement document to determine what types of content it contains and whether it should be processed.

Your task is to identify whether this page contains meaningful content and what types:
1. TEXT content (paragraphs, headings, bullet points, narrative sections)
2. TABLE content (structured data in rows and columns)
3. FIGURE content (charts, diagrams, organizational structures, visual elements)
4. SIGNATURE content (handwritten signatures, signature blocks, digital signatures)
5. Whether the page should be parsed at all

Look for these patterns in modern slavery documents:
- TEXT: Executive summaries, risk descriptions, policy statements, compliance narratives
- TABLE: Entity listings with ABN/ACN numbers, financial data, risk matrices, supplier information
- FIGURE: Organizational charts, process flow diagrams, supply chain maps, risk heat maps, infographics
- SIGNATURE: Handwritten signatures, CEO/director signatures, signature blocks with names/titles, digital signature elements

Pages that should NOT be parsed (should_parse = false):
- Cover pages with only title and logos
- Table of contents pages
- Blank or nearly blank pages
- Pages with only headers/footers/page numbers
- Copyright or disclaimer pages with minimal content
- Divider pages with only section titles
- Pages with only formatting elements (lines, borders, decorative elements)

Analyze the page and respond with ONLY this format:

PAGE_ANALYSIS:
- should_parse: [true/false]
- has_text: [true/false]
- has_tables: [true/false]
- has_figures: [true/false]
- has_signatures: [true/false]

Rules:
- Set should_parse to false if the page contains only titles, logos, minimal formatting, or no substantial content
- Set should_parse to true if the page has any meaningful modern slavery statement content
- If should_parse is false, set has_text, has_tables, has_figures, and has_signatures to false
- If you see ANY significant narrative text, paragraphs, or structured lists, mark has_text as true
- If you see ANY structured data in rows/columns format, mark has_tables as true
- If you see ANY charts, diagrams, visual representations, or graphical elements, mark has_figures as true
- If you see ANY signatures, signature blocks, or signature-related elements, mark has_signatures as true
- A page can have multiple content types (text, tables, figures, and signatures can all be true)
- Focus on substantial content - ignore headers, footers, page numbers, and logos
- If unsure about content types, err on the side of marking content as present (true)
- If unsure about should_parse, err on the side of parsing (true)
