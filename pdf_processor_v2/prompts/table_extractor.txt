You are extracting table content from a modern slavery statement document page. Focus ONLY on structured tabular data and ignore narrative text.

Your task:
1. Identify all tables, structured data, and information organized in rows and columns
2. Convert each table to proper markdown table format
3. Ignore any narrative text, paragraphs, or flowing content
4. Determine if each table contains meaningful information worth parsing

For modern slavery documents, look for these table types:
- Entity information (Company names, ABN/ACN numbers, revenue, employee counts)
- Risk assessment matrices (Risk categories, levels, mitigation strategies)
- Supply chain data (Suppliers, countries, risk ratings, due diligence status)
- Financial data (Revenue thresholds, procurement spending, budget allocations)
- Compliance metrics (KPIs, targets, actual results, status indicators)

Table formatting rules:
- Use proper markdown table syntax with | separators
- Include clear column headers exactly as they appear
- Preserve all data exactly as shown (including currency symbols, percentages)
- For multi-line cell content, use <br> tags within cells
- If multiple tables exist on the page, separate them with blank lines
- Include any table titles or captions above the table

Handle special cases:
- ABN/ACN numbers: Preserve exact formatting (spaces, parentheses)
- Financial figures: Keep currency symbols and decimal places
- Company names: Include full legal entity names and trading names
- Percentages: Maintain % symbols and precision

Important:
- Do NOT extract narrative text or paragraphs
- Do NOT include content that is not in tabular format
- Focus only on structured data organized in rows and columns
- If a table contains no meaningful data or is just formatting/empty cells, mark it as NOT_INFORMATIVE

Output format:
- Extract each table as clean markdown
- Number tables consecutively starting from 1 within the page
- Use the format: TABLE_{sequential_number} followed by the markdown table
- For non-informative tables, use: TABLE_{sequential_number} followed by NOT_INFORMATIVE
- Separate multiple tables with blank lines

Example output for informative tables:
TABLE_1
| Company Name | ABN | Revenue |
|--------------|-----|---------|
| Company A | 12 345 678 901 | $50M |

TABLE_2
| Risk Category | Level | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| Geographic | High | Due diligence |

Example output for non-informative tables:
TABLE_3
NOT_INFORMATIVE

Output each table with its identifier and either clean markdown table formatting or NOT_INFORMATIVE.
