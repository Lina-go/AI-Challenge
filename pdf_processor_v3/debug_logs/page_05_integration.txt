# WHISTLEBLOWER SYSTEM

Rheinmetall Group provides a whistleblowing tool for employees and suppliers to raise any concerns with regard to matters covered by the Group’s Code of Conduct. A Confidential Whistleblower Hotline Service, whistleblowing policies and other implemented safeguards are protecting the identity and integrity of any whistleblower.

Any potential breach of this policy/related policies will be managed in accordance with our standard processes. Any person involved in investigations into possible breaches of compliance are managed with procedural fairness. Where we identify failures by our employees to adhere to our code of conduct and policy, we take appropriate steps to address those failings. This may involve disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Any information that is received is systematically analysed. An incident management guideline on how to deal with suspected cases aims to ensure that the handling of information is also independent, transparent and fair as well as being subject to high standards.

## HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT

Rheinmetall Defence Australia is committed to providing a physical and psychologically safe workplace for all employees, contractors, visitors and the wider community. We will achieve this by minimising our impact on the environments in which we work, and taking an integrated approach to managing health, wellbeing, safety and environmental (“HSE”) risks. By doing this we believe our management of health and safety contributes to the health and safety of those we interact with, including our customers and partners.

We recognise that workers’ performance may be negatively affected where they are aggrieved or feel that they have not been treated fairly in the workplace. Rheinmetall Defence Australia is therefore committed to providing a workplace which is free from victimisation and values fairness, safety, and equality by providing all employees with access to a grievance and appeal procedure where they have a legitimate personal grievance related to the workplace. Rheinmetall Defence Australia encourage employees to raise grievances where they arise in line with policies and procedures. We will aim to deal with any complaints received in a prompt, sensitive, impartial, confidential and supportive way to seek a resolution and to prevent future conflict.

## INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY REVIEWS

Rheinmetall Group supports transparent reporting based on globally recognized standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative and – where possible – through continuous improvement of customer and Environment, Social and Governance ratings from internationally renowned agencies such as MSCI, ISS ESG, Sustainalytics and Gaia.

The Human Rights and Supply Chain subcategory metric of the Global Reporting Initiative measures a company’s commitment to respecting fundamental human rights conventions, and its ability to maintain its license to operate by supporting freedom of association and excluding child, forced or compulsory labour. This subcategory covers a company’s transparency in overseas sourcing disclosure and monitoring and a company’s relationship with and respect for the human rights of Indigenous peoples near its proposed or current operations.

Rheinmetall Group achieved high scores and an above industry average in its CSR / ESG Results:

## FUTURE COMMITMENTS

The mining of raw materials such as bauxite, nitrocellulose (linters), tin, tungsten, copper, cobalt, gold, aluminum and the processing of raw materials such as plastics and semiconductors (mica) in various regions around the world such as Guinea, Brazil, the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Vietnam poses a potential risk of human rights violations. Cases of child and forced labor, lack of health and safety protection, violence and harassment have become known through media reports and pose potential negative impacts through the use or extraction of materials.

The generic analysis of the deeper value chain (Tier N suppliers) and their processes confirmed these potential risks, although no specific group of affected parties was identified. Rheinmetall plans to gain more comprehensive insights into the upstream value chain at the Tier N supplier level from 2025 onwards.
