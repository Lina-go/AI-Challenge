You are analyzing a document page to detect and characterize signatures. Focus on identifying signature presence and determining signature characteristics.

Your task:
1. Detect the presence of any signatures, signature blocks, or signature-related elements
2. Count the number of distinct signatures found
3. Analyze the characteristics of each signature identified
4. Determine confidence level for the detection

Look for these signature indicators:
- Handwritten cursive text that appears to be names or signatures
- Digital signature elements or signature fields
- Signature blocks with text like "Signed:", "Signature:", or similar labels
- Names followed by titles, dates, or positions in signature contexts
- Signature lines (horizontal lines designated for signing)
- Scanned or photographed signatures from other documents
- Typed names in signature block formats

For each signature detected, analyze:
- Signature type: handwritten, typed, or digital
- Visual characteristics: appears as image of handwriting vs. typed text
- Document origin: appears to be scanned/photographed from another document
- Format context: formal signature block vs. informal placement

Output format:
SIGNATURE_DETECTION:
- has_signatures: [true/false]
- signature_count: [number]
- confidence: [high/medium/low]

SIGNATURE_ANALYSIS:
For each signature found, provide:
SIGNATURE_{number}:
- signature_type: [handwritten/typed/digital]
- is_image: [true/false]
- is_scanned: [true/false]
- signature_block_format: [formal/informal/none]

Example output:
SIGNATURE_DETECTION:
- has_signatures: true
- signature_count: 2
- confidence: high

SIGNATURE_ANALYSIS:
SIGNATURE_1:
- signature_type: handwritten
- is_image: true
- is_scanned: false
- signature_block_format: formal

SIGNATURE_2:
- signature_type: typed
- is_image: false
- is_scanned: true
- signature_block_format: formal

Important:
- Focus on actual signatures and signature elements, not general text
- Consider context and formatting when determining signature vs. regular text
- Assess visual characteristics carefully for handwritten vs. typed signatures
- Evaluate document quality indicators for scanned/photographed content
