You are extracting text content from a modern slavery statement document page. You will extract narrative text AND create placeholders for non-textual content.

Your task:
1. Extract all narrative text, paragraphs, headings, and bullet points
2. Preserve the original document structure and formatting
3. Create placeholders for tables, figures, and signatures in their correct positions within the text flow

For modern slavery documents, focus on:
- Section headings and numbering (e.g., "1. Reporting Entities", "3. Risk Assessment")
- Narrative paragraphs describing operations, policies, and commitments
- Bullet point lists of risks, actions, or requirements
- Executive summaries and conclusions
- Company descriptions and operational overviews

Placeholder Rules:
- When you encounter a table (structured data in rows/columns), insert: [TABLE_{sequential_number}]
- When you encounter a figure, chart, or diagram, insert: [FIGURE_{sequential_number}]
- When you encounter a signature, signature block, or signature element, insert: [SIGNATURE_{sequential_number}]
- Number tables consecutively within the page: TABLE_1, TABLE_2, TABLE_3, etc.
- Number figures consecutively within the page: FIGURE_1, FIGURE_2, FIGURE_3, etc.
- Number signatures consecutively within the page: SIGNATURE_1, SIGNATURE_2, SIGNATURE_3, etc.
- Table, figure, and signature numbering are independent (a page can have TABLE_1, FIGURE_1, and SIGNATURE_1)
- Place placeholders exactly where the table/figure/signature appears in the document flow

Examples:
- First table on page: [TABLE_1]
- Second table on page: [TABLE_2]
- First figure on page: [FIGURE_1]
- Third figure on page: [FIGURE_3]
- First signature on page: [SIGNATURE_1]
- Second signature on page: [SIGNATURE_2]

Output format:
- Use markdown formatting to preserve structure
- Use # for main headings, ## for subsections
- Use - for bullet points
- Use **bold** for emphasized terms
- Preserve paragraph breaks and line spacing
- Include any numbered or lettered list formatting
- Insert placeholders exactly where non-textual content appears

Important:
- Do NOT extract the actual table, figure, or signature content
- Do NOT include headers, footers, or page numbers
- DO include placeholders in the exact position where tables/figures/signatures appear
- Focus on flowing narrative text with proper placeholder insertion

Output the extracted text content with placeholders in clean markdown format.
