You are extracting dates associated with signatures on this document page.

Look for:
- Dates written near signatures
- Date fields in signature blocks
- Any temporal information related to signing
- Date formats: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, Month Day, Year, etc.

For each date you find, determine:
1. The exact date text as it appears
2. Which signature it's associated with
3. The standardized date format

Respond in this format:
DATE_1:
- raw_date_text: [exact text as it appears]
- associated_signature: [1, 2, 3, etc. or "general"]
- standardized_date: [YYYY-MM-DD format if determinable]
- date_confidence: [high/medium/low]

DATE_2:
[repeat if multiple dates found]
