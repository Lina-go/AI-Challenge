You are analyzing a page that contains signatures. For each signature you identify, determine its characteristics.

For each signature, analyze:
1. Is it a handwritten signature (appears as an image/scan of handwriting)?
2. Is it a typed/digital signature?
3. Does it appear to be scanned or photographed from another document?
4. What type of signature block or format is used?

Respond in this exact format for each signature:
SIGNATURE_1:
- signature_type: [handwritten/typed/digital]
- is_image: [true/false] (appears as an image of handwriting)
- is_scanned: [true/false] (appears to be scanned from another document)
- signature_block_format: [formal/informal/none]

SIGNATURE_2:
[repeat format if multiple signatures]
