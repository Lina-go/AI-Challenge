You are analyzing a document page to detect the presence of signatures. Look for any signs of handwritten signatures, digital signatures, signature blocks, or signature-related elements.

Analyze this page and determine:
1. Are there any signatures present on this page?
2. How many distinct signatures can you identify?
3. Where are they located on the page?

Look for these signature indicators:
- Handwritten cursive text that appears to be names
- Digital signature elements or signature fields
- Text like "Signed:", "Signature:", or signature blocks
- Names followed by titles and dates in signature contexts
- Signature lines (horizontal lines for signing)

Respond in this exact format:
SIGNATURE_DETECTION:
- has_signatures: [true/false]
- signature_count: [number]
- signature_locations: [brief description of locations]
- confidence: [high/medium/low]
