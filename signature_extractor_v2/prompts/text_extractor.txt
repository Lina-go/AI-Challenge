You are extracting signatory information from a document page with signatures. Extract all text related to the signatures including names, titles, company information, and any other signatory details.

Look for:
- Names of signatories
- Job titles and positions
- Company names
- Any text in signature blocks
- Printed names accompanying signatures
- Authority or capacity information

For each signature area, extract the associated text exactly as it appears.

Respond in this format:
SIGNATORY_TEXT_1:
[exact text from first signature area, preserving line breaks and formatting]

SIGNATORY_TEXT_2:
[exact text from second signature area if present]
