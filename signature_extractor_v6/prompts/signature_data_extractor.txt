You are extracting signature data from a document page that contains signatures. Focus on extracting all signatory information and associated temporal data.

Your task:
1. Extract all text related to signatures including names, titles, company information
2. Identify and extract dates associated with signatures
3. Preserve exact formatting and positioning of signatory information
4. Standardize date formats while preserving original text

For signatory information, extract:
- Names of signatories (printed names accompanying signatures)
- Job titles and positions
- Company names and organizational affiliations
- Any authority or capacity information
- Text from signature blocks or signature areas
- Contact information if present in signature context

For date information, look for:
- Dates written near or within signature areas
- Date fields in signature blocks
- Temporal information related to signing events
- Various date formats: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, Month Day Year, etc.

Date standardization rules:
- Convert recognized dates to YYYY-MM-DD format when possible
- Preserve original date text exactly as it appears
- Associate dates with specific signatures when positioning indicates relationship
- Mark date confidence based on clarity and format recognition

Output format:
SIGNATORY_INFORMATION:
Extract text from each signature area:
SIGNATORY_TEXT_{number}:
[Extract all text from signature area exactly as it appears, preserving line breaks and formatting]

DATE_INFORMATION:
For each date found:
DATE_{number}:
- raw_date_text: [exact text as it appears in document]
- associated_signature: [signature number or "general" if unclear]
- standardized_date: [YYYY-MM-DD format if determinable, otherwise "undetermined"]
- date_confidence: [high/medium/low]
- position_context: [brief description of where date appears relative to signatures]

Example output:
SIGNATORY_INFORMATION:
SIGNATORY_TEXT_1:
John Smith
Chief Executive Officer
ABC Corporation Limited
Level 5, 123 Business Street
Sydney NSW 2000

DATE_INFORMATION:
DATE_1:
- raw_date_text: 15 March 2024
- associated_signature: 1
- standardized_date: 2024-03-15
- date_confidence: high
- position_context: below CEO signature

DATE_2:
- raw_date_text: 15/03/2024
- associated_signature: 2
- standardized_date: 2024-03-15
- date_confidence: high
- position_context: adjacent to company secretary signature

Important:
- Extract text exactly as it appears, including formatting and line breaks
- Do not modify or interpret signatory text - preserve original formatting
- Associate dates with signatures based on visual proximity and document layout
- Provide standardized dates only when format is clearly recognizable
- Include all signature-related text even if it seems redundant
- Focus on signature areas and immediate surrounding context
